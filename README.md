# basic-python-voice-chatbot
A beginner-friendly Python voice chatbot project. This repository contains the code for a basic, command-line based voice chatbot with rule-based logic. It serves as a starting point for learning about voice interaction in Python and can be expanded with more advanced chatbot logic or integration with language models (like Ollama).
