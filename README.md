# Getting Started with Your Basic Voice Chatbot

This guide will walk you through the steps to set up and run a simple voice chatbot using Python. This is the foundational version of the chatbot, using basic rule-based responses and voice interaction.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed and set up:

1.  **Python:**
    *   You need Python 3.6 or later installed on your system.
    *   **To check if you have Python installed and its version:** Open your Command Prompt or Terminal and run:
        ```bash
        python --version
        ```
        You should see the Python version number printed. If you get an error, you need to download and install Python from [https://www.python.org/](https://www.python.org/).  During installation, ensure you check the option to "Add Python to PATH" (especially on Windows).

2.  **pip (Python Package Installer):**
    *   pip usually comes bundled with Python installations (for Python 3.4 and later).
    *   **To check if pip is installed and its version:** Open your Command Prompt or Terminal and run:
        ```bash
        pip --version
        ```
        You should see the pip version number. If you get an error, you may need to install or update pip.

3.  **Ollama (Not Required for this *Basic* Chatbot, but mentioned for future expansion):**
    *   For this very basic chatbot, we are *not* using Ollama or any large language model. However, if you plan to expand your chatbot later to use more intelligent responses (like with Llama 3), you will need to install Ollama.
    *   You can download and install Ollama from [https://ollama.com/](https://ollama.com/). Follow the installation instructions for your operating system.
    *   **For this basic guide, Ollama is NOT required to be installed or running.**

## Steps to Implement the Basic Voice Chatbot

Follow these steps to create and run your basic voice chatbot:

1.  **Install Python Libraries:**
    *   Open your Command Prompt or Terminal.
    *   Run the following commands one by one to install the necessary Python libraries:
        ```bash
        pip install SpeechRecognition
        pip install pyttsx3
        ```
        These commands will download and install the `SpeechRecognition` (for voice-to-text) and `pyttsx3` (for text-to-speech) libraries.

2.  **Copy and Save the Python Code:**
    *   Copy the following Python code block:

    ```python
    import speech_recognition as sr
    import pyttsx3

    # Initialize speech recognition and text-to-speech engines
    recognizer = sr.Recognizer()
    engine = pyttsx3.init()

    def recognize_speech():
        """
        Listens for speech from the microphone and converts it to text.
        """
        with sr.Microphone() as source:
            print("Listening...")
            recognizer.adjust_for_ambient_noise(source) # Adjust for background noise
            audio = recognizer.listen(source)

        try:
            print("Recognizing...")
            text = recognizer.recognize_google(audio) # Use Google Web Speech API
            print(f"You said: {text}")
            return text.lower() # Convert to lowercase for easier processing
        except sr.UnknownValueError:
            print("Could not understand audio")
            return ""
        except sr.RequestError as e:
            print(f"Could not request results from Google Speech Recognition service; {e}")
            return ""

    def generate_response(user_input):
        """
        Generates a chatbot response based on the user input.
        (Basic rule-based responses for this example - can be expanded)
        """
        if "hello" in user_input or "hi" in user_input:
            return "Hello there! How can I help you today?"
        elif "how are you" in user_input:
            return "I am doing well, thank you for asking! How about you?"
        elif "what is your name" in user_input:
            return "I am a simple chatbot. You can call me VoiceBot for now."
        elif "bye" in user_input or "exit" in user_input or "goodbye" in user_input:
            return "Goodbye! Have a great day."
        else:
            return "I'm still learning, could you please rephrase or ask something else?"

    def speak_response(text):
        """
        Converts text to speech and speaks it out loud.
        """
        engine.say(text)
        engine.runAndWait()

    def main():
        """
        Main function to run the voice chatbot.
        """
        print("Voice Chatbot Started!")
        speak_response("Voice Chatbot Started!") # Initial voice greeting

        while True:
            user_input = recognize_speech()
            if user_input: # Only process if speech was recognized
                response = generate_response(user_input)
                print(f"Chatbot: {response}")
                speak_response(response)

                if "bye" in user_input or "exit" in user_input or "goodbye" in user_input:
                    break # Exit the loop if user says goodbye

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        main()
    ```

    *   Open a plain text editor (like Notepad on Windows, TextEdit on macOS, or any code editor).
    *   Paste the code into the text editor.
    *   Save the file as `voice_chatbot.py` in a folder of your choice. Make sure to save it with the `.py` extension.

3.  **Run the Python Script:**
    *   Open your Command Prompt or Terminal.
    *   Navigate to the directory where you saved `voice_chatbot.py` using the `cd` command (change directory). For example, if you saved it on your Desktop, you might use `cd Desktop`.
    *   Run the script by typing:
        ```bash
        python voice_chatbot.py
        ```
        and press Enter.

4.  **Interact with the Voice Chatbot:**
    *   The chatbot will start and print "Voice Chatbot Started!" and speak this message.
    *   Wait for "Listening..." to appear in the console.
    *   Speak into your microphone.
    *   The chatbot will attempt to recognize your speech, print what you said, and then respond with a voice output.
    *   Try saying "Hello", "How are you?", "What is your name?", or "Bye".
    *   To exit the chatbot, say "bye", "exit", or "goodbye".

## Next Steps and Improvements (Optional)

This is a very basic voice chatbot. Here are some ideas for how you can expand and improve it:

*   **More Sophisticated Chatbot Logic:**
    *   Expand the `generate_response` function to handle more questions and topics.
    *   Use more advanced techniques like pattern matching or intent recognition for more flexible responses.
    *   Implement state management to make the chatbot remember context from previous turns in the conversation.

*   **Integrate with a Language Model (LLM):**
    *   To make your chatbot much more intelligent and conversational, integrate it with a large language model like those available through Ollama (e.g., Llama 3, Mistral, Gemma) or cloud-based APIs (like OpenAI's GPT models).  This will replace the simple rule-based `generate_response` function with a powerful AI model.

*   **Create a Graphical User Interface (UI):**
    *   Instead of running in the command line, create a user-friendly graphical interface using libraries like Tkinter, PyQt, or Kivy. This can make the chatbot much more pleasant to use.

*   **Explore Different Models and Features:**
    *   Experiment with different language models from Ollama or other sources to find one that best suits your needs.
    *   Explore more advanced features of `speech_recognition` and `pyttsx3` libraries for finer control over voice input and output.

Have fun building and improving your voice chatbot!
